## Background

As a part of a this assignment medical research company is interested in finding better ways to predict myopia. My team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, our supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

We were provided with raw data, so you’ll first need to process it to fit the machine learning model andl use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. We were also asked to visual our findings 


The following activities were completeed: 

* Part 1: Prepare the Data

* Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction 

* Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

* Part 4: Make a Recommendation 
The recommendation is to break the patients into 3 distinct groups, this will provide for better analyzing
